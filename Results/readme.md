We publish the criminal jargons identified by our approach for law enforcement agencies to catch up with rapid-evolving darknet jargons and for the public to be alert to criminal conversations.

However, due to the sensitivity of the darknet jargons, we will not distribute the found jargons directly, we show examples of some crime categories and we will leave the contact information for law enforcement agencies and the public to request for Full results.

Please contact Liang Ke (keliang001@stu.scu.edu.cn) for the Full detected jargon lists.
